# FastAPI-in-Action-Real-Time-API-Security-and-Anomaly-Detection
Real-time API security with FastAPI: uses JWT for secure, short-lived auth tokens. Anomaly detection &amp; IP monitoring block brute-force, token hijacking, &amp; DDoS attacks by flagging suspicious activity—like too many failed logins—and banning IPs. A scalable defense that could’ve prevented breaches like Facebook’s token leak.
